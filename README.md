# nRF8001 SDK for ARM

A WIP port of Nordic Semiconductor's SDK for the nRF8001 BLE chip for ARM. The eventual goal is to
build a standalone static library that isn't tied to any particular vendor's peripheral library.

SDK to the STM32F4 that uses the STM32 HAL extensively. This was an invaluable resource and served
as a starting point.
